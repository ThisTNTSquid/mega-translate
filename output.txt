Yes, they are
Why do I meet all those years?
Check them all
You need to say that healing water
But they did not cure
Oh yeah
In California, they are the ones that are
I'm young and free
Forget what it was
The earth, before the feet

There is a difference between us
It's a mile because

in the other part
I have called for a number of times
I tell you, I feel all that I did
But when you call, you're not home
Welcome to go
At least it has been heard
I tell you, I feel that I feel your heart
But it does not matter what, it is obligatory that you have not mined
Not too

Yes, where is it?
It's common to tell me about me, it's sad
I hope to make a decision
Have you ever left that city?
Did not happen to me?

What is not the secret?
The time is over

So, look at the other song (on the other side)
I had to call you many times (thousand times)
I tell you, I feel all that I did
But when you call, you're not home
Export (out)
At least tried (tried)
I tell you, I feel that I feel your heart
But it does not matter what, it is obligatory that you have not mined
Not too

(High, high, high, low, lower, lower, low, low
Not too
(High, high, high, low, lower, lower, low, low
Not too
(High, high, high, low, lower, lower, low, low
Not too
(High, high, high, low, lower, lower, low, low
Not too

After a band (in another part)
I had to call you many times (thousand times)
I tell you, I feel all that I did
But when you call, you're not home
Export (out)
At least tried (tried)
I will say, I feel my heart breaks
But it does not matter, of course, you have not exercised
Not too
